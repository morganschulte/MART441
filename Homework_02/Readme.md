This week's work focused on working with console logs as an introduction to JavaScript. I started with the course website and then with Code Academy. I felt comfortable doing the assignment and didn't run into any issues. I know this week had a shorter workload to leave time to review HTML and CSS, and at the time of writing this, its Wednesday. I plan to spend the next couple of days working away at some of the concepts I'm rusty on.

The main concept I need to refresh on is CSS dropdown menus. I wanted to make sure this homework site and future homework sites all linked to each other, so I want to create a dropdown menu for that. I just put them in as an ordered list for now, and I'll work on figuring out a dropdown navigation for a much cleaner look.

The only problem that I faced in the console log was the inability to put an apostrophe in while writing without closing the string. I solved that by not using conjunctions.
