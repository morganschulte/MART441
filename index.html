    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome! I'm Morgan Holcomb Schulte, a senior at the University of Montana's School of Visual and Media Arts. I'm pursuing my degree in Media Arts and looking forward to starting a career in the tech field. I'm originally from the Midwest, but I made my way out to Montana after graduating high school in 2013. My hobbies and work outside of school include photography, stained glass, ski coaching, backpacking, and more. If I'm not at home with my partner, two dogs, and my cat, I'm out in the mountains exploring.</p>

    <h2>My Viewpoin (on the World)</h2>
    <p>I believe that the world is full of opportunity and learning experiences. I think that learning should be accessible to as many people as possible, and that society benefits from access to education. I think we should take care of each other and our outdoor spaces, and that community can be created wherever people are found.</p>
